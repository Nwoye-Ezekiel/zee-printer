# 🖨️ Animated Receipt Printer – Zee Printer

This is a pixel-perfect, animated receipt printer created entirely with **pure CSS** - no images, no SVGs, no icons. It features dynamic printing effects, responsive scaling, a blinking indicator, sound feedback during printing, and clean DOM management, all designed to mimic real-world hardware behavior.
